# Chapter 8: Controlling access to objects

**1. After running the following code, which of the following
expressions will throw an exception and why?**

```
const ninja = {
    get name() {
        return "Akiyama";
    }
}
```

a. `ninja.name()`
b. `const name = ninja.name`

`a.` will throw an exception because there is no method called `name`
declared. In option `b.` the getter is called implicitly.

**2. In the following code, which mechanism allows getters and setters
to access a private object variable**

```
function Samurai() {
    const _weapon = "katana";
    Object.defineProperty(this, "weapon", {
        get: () => _weapon
    });
}

const samurai = new Samurai();
assert(samurai.weapon === "katana", "A katana wielding samurai");
```

The mechanism that allow us to do this are te closures. The getter is
creating a closure around `_weapon` keeping it alive.

**3. Which of the following assertions will pass?**

```
const daimyo = {name: "Matsu", clan: "Takasu"};

const proxy = new Proxy(daimyo, {
    get: (target, key) => {
        if (key === "clan") {
            return "Tokugawa";
        }
    }
});

assert(daimyo.clan === "Takasu", "Matsu of clan Takasu");
assert(proxy.clan === "Tokugawa", "Matsu of clan Tokugawa?");

proxy.clan = "Tokugawa"

assert(daimyo.clan === "Takasu", "Matsu of clan Takasu");
assert(proxy.clan === "Tokugawa", "Matsu of clan Tokugawa?");
```

The third assertion will fail, because when we are setting the
`"Tokugawa"` value in the `proxy.clan` property as we have no set trap,
this action is carried to the target, `daimyo` in this case, so this value
is changed.

**4. Which of the following assertions will pass?**

```
const daimyo = {name: "Matsu", clan: "Takasu", armySize: 10000};

const proxy = new Proxy(daimyo, {
    set: (target, key, value) => {
        if (key === "armySize") {
            const number = Number.parseInt(value);
            if (!Number.isNaN(number) {
                target[key] = number;
            }
        } else {
            target[key] = value;
        }
    }
});

assert(daimyo.armySize === 10000, "Matsu has 10 000 men at arms");
assert(proxy.armySize === 10000, "Matsu has 10 000 men at arms");

proxy.armySize = "large";

assert(daimyo.armySize === "large", "Matsu has a large army")

daimyo.armySize = "large";
assert(daimyo.armySize === "large", "Matsu has a large army")
```

If there are no trap defined for get it will return the value of the
target `daimyo`.

The third assertion will fail because it enters in the set trap of the
proxy that evaluate this property as a number, but the fourth assertion
will pass because it bypass the proxy by assigning the property directly.
