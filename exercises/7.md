# Chapter 7: Object orientation with prototypes

**1. Which of the following properties points to an object that will
be searched if the target object doesn't have the searched-for
property?**

`prototype`

**2. What's the value of variable `a1` after the following code is
executed?**

```
function Ninja() {}
Ninja.prototype.talk = function() {
    return 'Hello';
}

const ninja = new Ninja();
const a1 = ninja.talk();
```

`a1` value will be `'Hello'`

**3. What's the value of `a1` after running the following code?**

```
function Ninja() {}
Ninja.message = 'Hello';

const ninja = new Ninja();
const a1 = ninja.message;
```

the value of `a1` will be `undefined`.

**4. Explain the difference between `getFullName` method in these two
code fragments:**

```
// First fragment
function Person(firstName, lastName) {
    this.firstName = firstName;
    this.lastName = lastName;

    this.getFullName = function() {
        retunr this.firstName + ' ' + this.lastName;
    }
}

// Second fragment
function Person(firstName, lastName) {
    this.firstName = firstName;
    this.lastName = lastName;
}

Person.prototype.getFullName = function() {
    retunr this.firstName + ' ' + this.lastName;
}
```

In the first fragment `getFullName` is declared as an `instance property`,
but in the second fragment is declared as a `prototype property`. The
`instance properties` will be present in each instance object created by
the constructor function, while `prototype properties` are only present
once in the prototype of each instance which is the same object and all
instances will have access to it through it's prototype. So for
functions that acts as methods is better to use `prototype properties`
because we won't be declaring the same logic again and again in every
single instance.

**5. After running the following code, what will `ninja.constructor`
point to?**

```
function Person() {}
function Ninja() {}

const ninja = new Ninja();
```

`ninja.constructor` will be pointing to `Ninja` function.

**6. After running the following code, what will `ninja.constructor`
     point to?**

     ```
     function Person() {}
     function Ninja() {}
     Ninja.prototype = new Person();
     const ninja = new Ninja();
     ```

`ninja.constructor` will be pointing to `Person` function.

Because of that in JavaScript 'object inheritance' we will have to
rebuild the constructor property of the child 'class' if we don't want
to lose it.

**7. Explain how `instanceof` operator works in the following example.**

```
function Warrior() {}

function Samurai() {}
Samurai.prototype = new Warrior();

var samurai = new Samurai();

samurai instanceof Warrior; //Explain
```

The `instanceof` operator is checking the prototype of the constructor
function `Samurai`, which is `Warrior` because we have changed it's
prototype with a new `Warrior` instance, and seeks it in the prototype
chain of the `samurai` instance, so it will be true.

In other words: Can we found the prototype of the object of the right of
the expression in the prototype chain of the object of the left of the
expression? The answer is yes.

**8. Translate the following ES6 code into ES5 code.**

```
class Warrior {
    constructor(weapon) {
        this.weapon = weapon;
    }

    wield() {
        return "Wielding " + this.weapon;
    }

    static duel(warrior1, warrior2) {
        return warrior1.wield() + " " warrior2.wield();
    }
```

Translation:

```
function Warrior(weapon) {
    this.weapon = weapon;
}

Warrior.prototype.wield = function () {
    return "Wielding " + this.weapon;
}

Warrior.duel(warrior1, warrior2) {
    return warrior1.wield() + " " warrior2.wield();
}
```
