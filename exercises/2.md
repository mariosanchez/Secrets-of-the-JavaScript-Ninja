# Chapter 2: Building the page at runtime

**1. What are the two phases in the lifecycle of a client-side web application?**

The two phases in the lifecycle of a client-side application are:

1. Page building
2. Event handling

**2. What is the main advantage of using `addEventListener` method
to register an event handler versus assigning a handler to a specific
element property?**

The main advantage of using `addEventListener` methods to register an
event handler is that we are allowed to register more than one 
event handler function for a particular event.

**3. How many events can be processed at once?**

Just one event can be processed at once.

**4. In what order are events from the event queue processed?**

FIFO: first input, first output.
