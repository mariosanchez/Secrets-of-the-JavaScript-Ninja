# Chapter 6: Functions for the future: generators and promises

**1. After running the following code, what are the values of variables
`a1` to `a4`?**

```
funtion *EvenGenerator() {
    let num = 2;
    while(ture) {
        yield num;
        num = num + 2;
    }
}

let generator = EvenGenerator();

let a1 = generator.next().value;
let a2 = generator.next().value;
let a3 = EvenGenerator().next().value;
let a4 = generator.next().value;
```

The values of those variables will be:

`a1` = `2`.

`a2` = `4`.

`a3` = `2`.

`a4` = `6`.

**2. What's the content of the `ninjas` array after running the following
code? (Hint: thing about `for-of` loop can be implemented with a `while`
loop.)**

```
function* NinjaGenerator() {
    yield "Yoshi";
    return "Hattori";
    yield "Hanzo";
}

var ninjas = [];

for (let ninja of NinjaGenerator()) {
    ninjas.push(ninja);
}

ninjas;
```

The content of `ninjas` will be `["Yoshi"]`. The iteration will stop when
there is no more code to run or it reaches the `return`, not including the
returned value.

**3. What are the values of the variables `a1` and `a2`, after running
the following code?**

```
function *Gen(val) {
    val = yield val * 2;
    yield val;
}

let generator = Gen(2);
let a1 = generator.next(3).value;
let a2 = generator.next(4).value;
```

The values of those variables will be:

`a1` = `4`. Because the `next(3)` have no waiting `yield`, it's ignored, then
we take the `2` value in of `val` in the generator initialization.

`a2` = `4`. In this case `next(4)` will be assigned to `val` in the first `yield`,
and returned in the second.

**4. What's the output of the following code?**

```
const promise = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    reject("Hattori");
});

promise.then(val => alert("Success: " + val))
    .catch(e => alert("Error: " + e));
```

The output will be an alert with the text `Error: Hattori`. The promise
is explicitly rejected.



**5. What's the output of the following code?**

```
const promise = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
resolve("Hattori");
setTimeout(() => reject("Yoshi"), 500);
});

promise.then(val => alert("Success: " + val))
    .catch(e => alert("Error: " + e));
```

The output will be an alert with the text `Success: Hattori`. Since the
promise is firstly resolved, we can not revert it's state 500 milliseconds
later in the timeout, it's lifecycle is finished.
